Reading the backup memory of SI-stations series 7/8
---------------------------------------------------

communication must be established

- read stations backup memory pointer
		instruction 0x83, see PCprog
		
- check out if there is "memory overflow"
		instruction 0x83
			0x83 0x3D 0x01
				memory overflow != 0x00

- read out backup memory
		read oldest data first
		
		memory overflow: start at address "memory pointer+1", read complete memory
		no memory overflow: start at address 0x000100, read until memory pointer address is achieved
		
		
read stored SI-card data

- read in block sizes of 128 byte

- check out first block to determine card type
		use "characteristic string" to detect card type
		
		"0xED 0xED 0xED 0xED"		--> SI-Card6 or SI-Card6*
					determine SI-Card6 or SI-Card6*
							a) global decision in event, flag in stations are set
							b) permanent SI-C6*, card number > 16.000.000
							
					expect
							3 blocks of data (SI-Card6)
							or
							8 blocks of data (SI-Card6*)
							
		"0xEA 0xEA 0xEA 0xEA"		--> SI-Card8/9/p/t
		
					expect
							2 blocks of data
							
		other case							--> SI-Card5
		
					expect
							1 block of data
							
- check out each of the following blocks for the "characteristic string" to detect incomplete stored SI-Card6/6*/8/9

	>>> problem: in case of incomplete data SI-Card5 can be treated as data from SI-Card6/6*/8/9/p/t
